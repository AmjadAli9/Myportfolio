            <h2>Education & Academic Pursuits</h2>
            <p>My academic journey began with a strong foundation in the State Board of Secondary Education, where I achieved 75% in my Senior Secondary Examination and 70% in my Secondary Examination. These early achievements set the stage for my current pursuit of a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Engineering.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In August 2024, I successfully completed a significant mini-project titled <strong>"Leaf and Spike Wheat Disease Detection & Classification using an Improved Deep Convolution Architecture."</strong> This project was a testament to my ability to design and implement advanced deep learning models. By integrating cutting-edge image processing techniques, I was able to achieve a remarkable 97.88% accuracy in detecting and classifying wheat diseases. The project also featured a user-friendly interface, allowing for real-time disease classification and analysis—bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and practical applications.</p>

            <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
            <p>My professional journey took a leap forward during my internship at Datapoint IT & Hardware Tech Pvt Ltd, where I gained invaluable experience in the field. This internship not only honed my technical skills but also enhanced my communication abilities. It was a unique opportunity to connect theory with real-world practice, and it gave me a deep understanding of working in a professional environment.</p>
